# General-knowledge-quiz-app
This project is a quiz application implemented using a client-server architecture of socket programming. The server provides a set of random questions to the clients, and the clients answer the questions within a time limit. The questions, options, and correct answers are stored in a JSON file. The server selects random questions from the JSON file and sends them to the clients. The clients display the questions and options using a Tkinter GUI and allow the users to select their answers. The clients send the answers back to the server for evaluation, and the server responds with whether the answers are correct or incorrect. The clients keep track of the score and display the result at the end of the quiz.
